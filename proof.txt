Check wheather a number is power of 2 or not .
1st method:
using an array to store all the power of two time comlexty and space comlexity are logn
.

2nd method:

use log function ;

3rd method :

using bit manipulation


let's define all the power of two and store it in an array.

How can we do that without using any extra space?

let say n=0000000..........upto 31 bits

because power of two cannot go beyond this.
Now,
take power of two and do or(|) operation with n because this is the only way to do without using extra space.

whenever you do this operation then you will find that if a number is power of two then bit of the number is is ony at the ith index.
